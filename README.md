ImageParallax-ZoomEffect
========================
This is an example code of how to produce a parallax-zoom effect on an image as a view slides over it. When the view is scrolled over the image, the image moves at a slower rate than the top view (hence the parallax effect). When the view is pulled down to the max, the image starts expanding in size and creates a zoom effect. Checkout the gif below which demonstrates the effect.
